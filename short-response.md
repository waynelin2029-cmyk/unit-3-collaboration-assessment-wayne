1. when collaborating with a classmate it is important to send a pull request, it is important because if no one sends a pull request then bugs will happen, like merging two branches together at the same time
2. devs use branches to fix, add, or try new things without making changes to the main branch, so they dont mess up their work
3. git is a distributed version control system, that all devs has access to all their change, github is a cloud based service that allows all devs to store, track, manage and control change to their code, they work together because github helps devs use git 
4. its `git add .` first then `git commit -m "message'`, lasty `git push`
